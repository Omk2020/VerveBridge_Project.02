Real-Time Fraud Detection System Using Streaming Data

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time fraud detection system that processes large streams of transaction data as they occur. The system utilizes machine learning models to classify transactions as either “fraudulent” or “legitimate” and triggers alerts for further investigation when fraud is detected.

Project Objectives

	•	Real-Time Data Processing: Process transaction data in real-time using streaming tools like Apache Kafka or Apache Spark.
	•	Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features such as time-based, location-based, and behavioral patterns from the data stream.
	•	Model Development: Develop and deploy machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
	•	Real-Time Detection and Alerts: Implement real-time detection with alerts for suspicious transactions.
	•	Visualization and Monitoring: Create dashboards for real-time monitoring of transactions and model performance.

Project Workflow

	1.	Setting up the Data Pipeline:
	•	Tools: Use Apache Kafka for message brokering and stream handling.
	•	Steps:
	•	Set up a Kafka producer to send real-time transaction data.
	•	Set up a Kafka consumer to read and process this data in real-time.
	2.	Real-Time Feature Engineering:
	•	Extract features like time since the last transaction, transaction frequency, location change, and behavioral patterns in real-time using tools like Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Spark Streaming.
	3.	Model Development:
	•	Offline Model Training: Train models like Isolation Forests for anomaly detection or supervised models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost using historical data.
	•	Real-Time Inference: Deploy the trained model into the real-time pipeline to classify incoming transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
	4.	Real-Time Detection:
	•	Process each incoming transaction in real-time using the deployed model.
	•	Trigger alerts if the model’s prediction probability exceeds a set threshold.
	5.	Model Retraining and Concept Drift:
	•	Regularly retrain the model to adapt to changing fraud patterns.
	•	Implement drift detection to monitor model performance and trigger retraining when necessary.
	6.	System Deployment:
	•	Deploy the system in a cloud environment using services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions to handle high volumes of real-time data.
	7.	Visualization and Monitoring Dashboard:
	•	Create dashboards using Grafana or Tableau to monitor transactions and model performance in real-time.
	8.	Evaluation and Model Metrics:
	•	Monitor metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to ensure system performance.
